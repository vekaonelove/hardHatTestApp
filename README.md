MultiSig Wallet Report
1. Design Decisions

The MultiSig Wallet contract is designed to require multiple ownersâ€™ approval before executing any transaction. This reduces the risk of unauthorized or accidental transfers.

    Owners and Confirmation Threshold: The wallet stores a list of owner addresses and a required number of confirmations needed to execute a transaction. This allows flexible configuration (e.g., 3 owners with 2 confirmations required).

    Transaction Struct: Transactions are represented by a struct holding target address, value, data, and execution status. This cleanly encapsulates all necessary info for an on-chain operation.

    Mappings for Confirmations: To track which owners have confirmed each transaction, a nested mapping confirmations[txIndex][owner] is used for efficient verification.

    Event Logging: Events are emitted on submission, confirmation, execution, and revocation for transparency and off-chain tracking.

    Access Control: Only owners can submit, confirm, revoke, or execute transactions, enforced by modifiers and require statements.

This structure balances simplicity, clarity, and security.
2. Multi-Sig Workflow

   Submission: An owner proposes a transaction by specifying the target address, Ether value, and optional data. The transaction is stored and an event emitted.

   Confirmation: Owners individually confirm the submitted transaction. Confirmations are tracked to prevent duplicates.

   Execution: Once the required number of confirmations is reached, any owner can execute the transaction, triggering an Ether transfer or contract call.

   Revocation: Before execution, an owner can revoke their confirmation, reducing the confirmation count.

This workflow enforces consensus, preventing unilateral actions.
3. Security Considerations

   Access Control: Only addresses in the owners list can interact with critical functions.

   Prevent Double Confirmation: Owners cannot confirm the same transaction more than once.

   Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern: State changes are made before external calls to prevent reentrancy.

   Reentrancy Protection: Execution updates transaction status before external calls.

   Input Validation: Reverts if transactions are invalid or unauthorized actions attempted.

   Event Emission: All state changes are logged for off-chain monitoring and auditing.

These safeguards mitigate common vulnerabilities in multi-sig wallets.
4. Deployment and Usage Instructions
   Deployment

   Configure your deployment script with the list of owners and required confirmation count.

   Use Hardhat or Truffle to deploy the contract to your desired network (local, testnet, mainnet).

   Example using Hardhat:

   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>

Usage

    Owners can submit transactions by specifying the destination, amount, and data.

    Each owner calls confirmTransaction(txIndex) to approve.

    Once enough confirmations are collected, an owner calls executeTransaction(txIndex) to perform the action.

    Owners can revoke confirmations before execution if needed.
